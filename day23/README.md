## --- Day 23: Safe Cracking ---
This is one of the top floors of the nicest tower in EBHQ. The Easter Bunny's private office is here, complete with a safe hidden behind a painting, and who *wouldn't* hide a star in a safe behind a painting?

The safe has a digital screen and keypad for code entry. A sticky note attached to the safe has a password hint on it: "eggs". The painting is of a large rabbit coloring some eggs. You see `7`.

When you go to type the code, though, nothing appears on the display; instead, the keypad comes apart in your hands, apparently having been smashed. Behind it is some kind of socket - one that matches a connector in your [prototype computer](11)! You pull apart the smashed keypad and extract the logic circuit, plug it into your computer, and plug your computer into the safe.


## --- Part Two ---
The safe doesn't open, but it *does* make several angry noises to express its frustration.

You're quite sure your logic is working correctly, so the only other thing is... you check the painting again. As it turns out, colored eggs are still eggs. Now you count `12`.

As you run the program with this new input, the prototype computer begins to *overheat*. You wonder what's taking so long, and whether the lack of any instruction more powerful than "add one" has anything to do with it. Don't bunnies usually *multiply*?

Anyway, *what value* should actually be sent to the safe?
